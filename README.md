chess server and application (html-css-js front end/node.js backend)

-the server runs on port 8080

-to connect to the server once you run it, go to http://[local ip of your server]:8080/ on your browser 

-when a user connects to the server, he will be transfered to the waiting room. If a player is already in the waiting room, a game will start between the both of them

PS: this is a local network application. Any attempt to connect to the server from a router other than the one your server is connected to will fail.
